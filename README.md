[Weaviate](https://weaviate.io/) is a [vector database](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/semantic-kernel/concepts-ai/vectordb) that allows you to create and query embeddings with pre—trained deep learning models. It integrates with ResNet—50 to vectorize images, making it possible to build an image similarity search engine with relative ease.
